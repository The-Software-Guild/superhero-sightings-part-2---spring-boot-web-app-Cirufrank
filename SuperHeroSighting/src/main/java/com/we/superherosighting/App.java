 * 
 * @description This application allows users to add, edit, and read resources
 * by interacting with the Superhero Sightings Application
 * 
 * It uses the MVC architectural paradigm to organize files
 * in order to keep code DRY while separating concerns
 * 
 * Through the use of local database storage the games and rounds created 
 * persist
 * 
 * Additionally, Spring dependency injection is utilized in order to take advantage
 * of loose coupling through Spring's Inversion of Control container
 * 
 * Lastly, Spring Boot starts Spring MVC with a main method
 *
 * Spring Boot is bundled with a Web Server
 * which is why Spring Boot starts the web server and not vice
 * versa
 *
